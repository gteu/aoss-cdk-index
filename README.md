# AOSS CDK Index

This sample project demonstrates how to manage OpenSearch Serverless indices using AWS CDK. It leverages custom resources to create, update, and delete indices in OpenSearch.

**Note:** This implementation only supports adding new fields to the index mappings. If you need to delete fields or change field types, additional implementation is required.
